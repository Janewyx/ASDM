# Species Distribution and Spread Modelling 
Spread modelling and visualisations of a forest invasive alien species (FIAS).

Code provided for visualising and modelling the distribution and spread of a forest 
invasive alien species with pre-processed species distribution data from Vivek Srivastava 
for the present period and future years under climate scenarios A1B and A2.
Created as a part of Geomatics for Environmental Management proof of concept class project under the 
supervision of Vivek Srivastava, Feb 16, 2018.
